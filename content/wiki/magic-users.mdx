### Casters - 25%
Casters are magic users who can channel mana through their own bodies. 25% of the population. They do not require a wand or channeling tool, but it often takes practice for a caster to be able to use their body as a conduit to channel magic.

**Casters can cast/use:**
- Vocal Magic (Incantation / Evocation)
- Channeled Magic, using their thoughts and body motions.
- This can be done via their bodies or a tool like a wand.
- Charms / Blessings (Creating magical items, or putting a spell on an item)
**Curses**
- Curses require a lot of power to cast, and are often cast by accident in heated emotions. It is very hard to cast an intentional curse.
- Curses can only be cast via incantation or evocation, which means only casters can curse.

### Channelers - 40%
Channelers are magic users who cast magic via a channeling tool, such as a wand or magic item. They can’t cast via their bodies.

**Channelers can use:**
- Channeled Magic, using their thoughts and a channeling tool.
- Channelers can only cast with help from a magic item like a wand that helps them draw the mana up to cast.
- All Elves are Channelers, *but not all casters.*

### Mundanes - 35%
Mundanes are about 35% of the population. They can’t draw mana up through their bodies or with help of a channeling tool.
- Mundanes can still use magic items, ones that are self-powered or powered by ambient mana.
